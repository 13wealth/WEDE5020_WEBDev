# Project: Website Enhancement for Education Organisation

<h2><u>Part 1</u></h2>
This project aims to upgrade and enhance the existing website of an organisation operating in the Education sector.

### The primary objectives are:

- **Improved User Experience (UX):** Introduce a more dynamic and functionally engaging design that minimizes excessive scrolling on the main page.  
- **Modern Look & Feel:** Refurbish the site with a refreshed colour theme that is visually appealing and aligns with the organisation’s brand.  
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Apply simplicity and responsive design principles to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.  
- **Increased Conversions:** Optimise the site’s layout and navigation to support higher user engagement and drive more registrations through the website.

### Future Development

In later phases, additional features will be integrated, including:
- PHP-based components such as online payments
- Learner portals for streamlined interaction with students and staff
At this stage, the focus is on delivering a complete visual and functional makeover of the current website.
